Polarity Checks (Dead + Live)

Dead polarity confirms:
• Line is not connected to neutral or earth.
• Line goes to switches, not neutral.
• CPCs are present and continuous.

Live polarity confirms:
• Line and neutral are in the correct terminals.
• Correct operation of switches and devices.

Incorrect polarity is dangerous — must be corrected immediately.
