Continuity of Protective Conductors (R1+R2)

Purpose:
To confirm the CPC is continuous from the consumer unit to every accessory.

Method:

Isolate the supply.

Link Line (R1) and CPC (R2) at the distribution board.

Test at each point on the circuit.

The highest reading is the “worst-case” Zs reference point.

Notes:
• On lighting circuits, check at switch drops carefully.
• If using long-lead method, measure R2 alone.
