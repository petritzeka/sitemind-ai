Insulation Resistance (IR)

Purpose:
To ensure conductors and equipment have adequate insulation.

Test:
• Use 500 V DC for most circuits (230 V single-phase).
• Test L–N, L–E, N–E.
• Minimum acceptable value: 1 MΩ for the whole installation.
• New installations typically show 200 MΩ+.

Notes:
• Disconnect sensitive equipment (dimmers, smart devices).
• If low, divide the circuit into parts to find the fault.
