Dead Tests (Before Energising)

Dead tests include:

• Continuity of protective conductors (CPC, bonding)
• Continuity of ring final circuit conductors
• Insulation resistance (L–N, L–E, N–E)
• Polarity (dead checks)
• Resistance of protective bonding conductors
• Verify SELV/PELV separation if applicable

Dead testing ensures the installation is electrically sound before introducing live voltage.
