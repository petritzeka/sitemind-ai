Live Tests (After Energising)

Live tests include:

• Earth fault loop impedance (Zs)
• External earth fault loop impedance (Ze)
• Prospective fault current (PSC/PEFC)
• RCD/RCBO testing
• Polarity under live conditions
• Functional testing (switching, operation of devices)

Live tests confirm disconnection performance and compliance with BS 7671 limits.
