Correct Sequence of Tests (BS 7671 Guidance)

Dead Tests:

Continuity of CPC

Continuity of ring final circuits

Insulation resistance

Polarity (dead)

Verification of bonding and SELV/PELV separation

Live Tests:
6. External fault loop impedance (Ze)
7. Prospective fault current (PSC/PEFC)
8. Zs on each circuit
9. RCD/RCBO testing
10. Functional checks

Following the sequence prevents damage to equipment and ensures safety.
