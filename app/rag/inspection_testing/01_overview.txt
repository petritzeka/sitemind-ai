Inspection & Testing Overview

Inspection and testing prove that an electrical installation is safe and compliant with BS 7671.
It is split into two stages:

Dead tests – performed with the supply isolated.

Live tests – performed after energising (when safe to do so).

Dead tests confirm basic safety and continuity.
Live tests confirm disconnection times, Zs, RCD operation, and polarity under real conditions.

Electricians follow a specific sequence of tests to avoid damage to equipment and ensure safety.
