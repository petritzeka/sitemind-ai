Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m applying for any Electrician’s Mate opportunities you have available. I’ve recently completed my electrical training (Level 2/3 fast-track) and I’m looking to gain real on-site experience.

I’m punctual, reliable, and confident with basic installation tasks such as containment, cable pulling, trunking, lighting replacements, and assisting with testing.

I have an ECS card and my own tools. I’m available immediately and open to short-term or long-term work.

Thank you for your time,
[Your Name]
