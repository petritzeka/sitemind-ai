Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m writing to apply for an Improver Electrician role. I have hands-on experience supporting domestic electrical work including lighting changes, socket additions, minor fault finding, and assisting with testing.

I hold Level 3 Electrical Installations and an ECS card. I can follow instructions, work safely, and support electricians effectively.

Thank you for considering my application.
