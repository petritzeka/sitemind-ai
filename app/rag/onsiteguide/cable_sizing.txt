Cable Sizing – OSG Essentials

Design rules:
• Ib ≤ In ≤ Iz
• Iz is cable current-carrying capacity from tables.
• Apply correction factors: Ca (ambient), Ci (insulation), Cg (grouping), Cf (device type).

Volt drop:
• Typical limits: 3% lighting, 5% other finals.
• Volt drop = (mV/A/m × Ib × length) ÷ 1000.

Common T&E sizes:
• 1.0 mm² lighting (6A)
• 1.5 mm² lighting (6A/10A)
• 2.5 mm² sockets (ring or 20A radial)
• 4.0 mm² 32A radial
• 6 mm² cooker/shower
• 10 mm²/16 mm² for high-load appliances or long runs.

CPC sizing:
• Usually built into T&E.
• For singles/SWA: use adiabatic or tables.
