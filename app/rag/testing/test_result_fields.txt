Test Result Fields – What Each Value Means

r1:
• Line conductor resistance on ring final circuits.

rn:
• Neutral conductor resistance on ring final circuits.

r2:
• CPC resistance on ring final circuits.

R1+R2:
• Line + CPC resistance to verify continuity.
• Used to calculate Zs: Zs = Ze + (R1+R2).

Insulation Resistance:
• Measured in MΩ between conductors.
• Minimum 1 MΩ for each test.

Polarity:
• Confirms correct connections.

Zs:
• Loop impedance of completed circuit.
• Must be below max Zs for protective device.

RCD Tests:
• 1/2 × IΔn (no trip)
• 1 × IΔn (trip <300 ms)
• 5 × IΔn (fast trip)

PFC:
• Prospective short-circuit current.
• Highest of PSCC/PEFC.

PEFC:
• Prospective earth fault current.

PSC:
• Prospective short-circuit current between L–N.

Notes/Remarks:
• Space for non-compliances, access issues, or limitations.
