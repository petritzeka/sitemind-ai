Dead Tests – Full Sequence (BS 7671 / OSG)

1. Continuity of Protective Conductors (R1+R2)
• Confirms CPC is continuous.
• Use long lead or end-to-end method.
• For lighting: R1+R2 is measured at the switch/light.

2. Continuity of Ring Final Circuits
• Measure r1, rn, r2 end-to-end.
• Cross-connect r1–rn and measure at sockets (figure-of-8).
• Cross-connect r1–r2 and test again.
• Check results are balanced.

3. Insulation Resistance (IR)
• Test between L–N, L–E, N–E.
• Use 500 V DC for new installs.
• Minimum reading: 1 MΩ (higher expected).
• Sensitive equipment may be disconnected.

4. Polarity (dead)
• Confirm correct connections: L to switches, N to neutral bar, CPC to earth bar.
• Ring polarity also confirmed during continuity tests.
