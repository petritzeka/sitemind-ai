TITLE: Installing PVC/PVC Cable Clipped Direct for Lighting Circuits

OVERVIEW:
PVC/PVC cable clipped direct is a common method for domestic lighting. This guide covers 1-way, 2-way and 3-way (intermediate) switching arrangements.

TOOLS / PPE:
- Cutters
- Hammer
- Screwdrivers
- Continuity tester
- Connector blocks
- Safety glasses

MATERIALS:
- 1.5 mm² twin & earth cable
- Switches (1-way, 2-way, intermediate)
- Ceiling roses or light points
- Cable clips
- Back boxes
- Earth sleeving

SAFETY CHECKS:
- Prove dead before working.
- Keep cable routes within safe zones.

METHOD:
1. Mark vertical and horizontal safe zones.
2. Clip cables neatly with consistent spacing.
3. Install switches:
   - 1-way: COM to L1.
   - 2-way: COM, L1, L2.
   - Intermediate: L1-L1 and L2-L2 through the switch.
4. Install ceiling rose:
   - Loop, neutral and switched live identified with sleeving.
   - CPC sleeved and terminated.
5. Test continuity of CPC, line and strappers.
6. Leave ready for insulation resistance testing.

GOOD PRACTICE:
- Straight cable runs.
- Switched live correctly sleeved brown.
- CPC sleeved at all points.
