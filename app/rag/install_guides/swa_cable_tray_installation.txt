TITLE: Installing SWA Cable on Cable Tray to an Isolator

OVERVIEW:
SWA cable provides mechanical protection and is commonly supported on metal cable tray. This guide covers mounting tray, creating a 90° bend, securing SWA neatly, glanding and terminating into an isolator.

TOOLS / PPE:
- Cutters
- Hammer
- Screwdrivers
- Continuity tester
- Measuring tape
- Hacksaw or tin snips
- Reamer/file
- Marker/pencil
- Level
- Pliers/grips
- Drill + metal drill bits (if needed)
- PPE (gloves, eye protection)

MATERIALS:
- SWA cable
- SWA glands (BW or CW)
- Cable tray (galvanised steel)
- Tray couplers or fishplates
- Cable ties or saddles
- Isolator switch
- Nuts, bolts and washers
- Screws / bolts for fixing tray

SAFETY CHECKS:
- Wear gloves when handling SWA and metal tray.
- Deburr all metal edges to protect the cable.
- Ensure tray is secured before loading cable.

METHOD:
1. Install cable tray:
   - Mark the route and ensure it is level.
   - Fix tray securely to brackets or Unistrut.
   - Maintain equal spacing of supports for neatness and strength.

2. Creating a 90° bend on metal tray:
   - Measure the location where the 90° turn is required.
   - Mark a straight line across both side rails.
   - Using a hacksaw or tin snips, cut ONLY the side rails—do not fully cut the base.
   - Leave the base intact so the tray can fold smoothly.
   - Carefully bend the tray to 90°, checking with a square/level.
   - File all cut edges to remove sharp burrs.
   - Reinforce the bend using tray couplers or fishplates and bolt them securely.

3. Laying SWA cable:
   - Place the SWA cable onto the tray.
   - Use cable ties or saddles at even spacing.
   - Avoid crushing the outer sheath or armour.
   - Maintain a smooth bend radius, especially at the 90° tray bend.

4. Preparing the SWA gland:
   - Strip the outer sheath carefully.
   - Splay armour strands evenly.
   - Fit gland components in the correct order.
   - Slide armour grip into place and tighten fully.

5. Terminating the SWA cable:
   - Fit gland into DB, enclosure or isolator.
   - Tighten locknut securely ensuring metal-to-metal contact.
   - Connect L, N and CPC inside the isolator or enclosure.
   - Verify earth continuity using tester.

GOOD PRACTICE:
- Tray runs straight and level.
- Bend radius smooth with reinforced plates.
- No sharp edges at cuts or bends.
- SWA secured without crushing.
- Gland correctly installed with tidy armour grip.

COMMON FAULTS:
- Bend not a true 90°, causing misalignment.
- Sharp edges left unfiled.
- SWA tied too tightly, damaging sheath.
- Gland components fitted in wrong order.
- Loose locknut causing poor earth continuity.
