BS 7671 Chapter 2 – Assessment of General Characteristics

Characteristics to determine before design:
• Supply type: TN-S, TN-C-S, TT.
• Nominal voltage: 230V single-phase, 400V three-phase.
• Prospective fault current (PFC/PSCC).
• External earth fault loop impedance (Ze).

Other factors:
• Maximum demand and diversity.
• External influences: water, heat, mechanical, corrosive.
• Compatibility with equipment.
• Overvoltages and undervoltages.

Purpose:
• Ensure the installation can meet demand safely.
• Ensure equipment is protected from fault conditions.
