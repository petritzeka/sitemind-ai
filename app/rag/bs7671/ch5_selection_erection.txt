BS 7671 Chapter 5 – Selection and Erection of Equipment

Key factors:
• Choose equipment suitable for voltage, current, and environmental conditions.
• Ensure correct IP ratings for location (IP44 bathrooms, etc.).
• Cables must be correctly supported and protected (no premature collapse).
• Follow safe zones for cable routes in walls.

Circuit design:
• Ib ≤ In ≤ Iz (load ≤ device ≤ cable rating).
• Check volt drop limits: 3% lighting, 5% other circuits.
• Consider fault currents and Zs values.

Equipment selection:
• Correct MCB types (B, C, D).
• Correct RCD types (AC, A, F, B).
• Correct CSA for earthing and bonding conductors.

Special requirements:
• Segregation of circuits.
• Avoid mechanical damage.
