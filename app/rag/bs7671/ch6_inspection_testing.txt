BS 7671 Chapter 6 – Inspection and Testing

Inspection:
• Visual checks before testing.
• Verify: identification, damage, IP rating, connections, bonding, accessibility.

Test sequence (dead → live):
Dead tests:
1. Continuity of protective conductors (R1+R2, R2)
2. Continuity of ring finals (r1, rn, r2)
3. Insulation resistance
4. Polarity (dead)

Live tests:
5. Ze (external impedance)
6. Zs (loop impedance)
7. Prospective fault current (PSCC/PEFC)
8. RCD tests (½ ×, 1 ×, 5 × IΔn)
9. Functional testing

Certification:
• EIC, EICR, Minor Works.
