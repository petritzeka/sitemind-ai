1️⃣ Unit Sequence (Always in this order)
1. Electrical Science & Principles

Unit code: ELEC3/08B

Usually taught first

Covers three-phase basics, inductance, capacitance, impedance, magnetic fields, motors, transformers

2. Design (On-Site Guide Allowed)

Unit code: ELEC3/04a

Taught after Electrical Science

Includes cable calculation, protective devices, CPC sizing, OSG referencing, volt drop, design procedures

3. Environmental Legislation

Unit code: QELTK3/002

Usually a short unit with simple theory

Covers Part L, efficiency, environmental responsibilities, sustainability topics

4. Inspection & Testing Theory

Unit code: QELTK3/006

Taught after Design & Environmental Legislation

Includes full I&T sequence, dead tests, live tests, documentation, EIC, fault categories

5. Fault Finding

Unit code: QELTK3/007

Taught last

Includes fault diagnosis, safe isolation, component testing, continuity, insulation faults, RCD faults, short circuits, open circuits

2️⃣ Practical Task Order (Typical)
During Electrical Science

Transformer basics

Motor principles

Three-phase board identification

During Design

Cable selection tasks

Volt-drop calculations

OSG referencing tasks

During Inspection & Testing

Safe isolation assessment

Full test sequence practice

Completing test sheets

Minor works & EIC practice

During Fault Finding

Identify common faults (open circuit / short / high resistance)

Simulated fault boards

Corrective solutions

3️⃣ Break Pattern (Typical Level 3)

If September intake:

Half-term (Nov)

Christmas break

If February intake:

Half-term only

If May intake:

Summer break (July–Aug)

Level 3 follows the same break structure as Level 2.

4️⃣ Exam Order (Aligned to Teaching Order)
✔ Electrical Science Exam (first)

30 questions — 60 mins — 60% to pass

✔ Design Exam

25 questions — 45 mins — OSG allowed

✔ Environmental Legislation Exam

20 questions — 40 mins

✔ Inspection & Testing Exam

40 questions — 80 mins

✔ Fault Finding Exam (last)

45 questions — 90 mins

5️⃣ Socrative Room Pathways (Level 3)

(For Study Plan Mode + Socrative Mode)

Science Rooms

L3S1 → L3S2 → L3S3 → L3S4
(85% required each to progress)

Design Rooms

L3D1 → L3D2 → L3D3

Environment

L3E1 → L3E2

Inspection & Testing Rooms

L3IT1 → L3IT2 → L3IT3 → L3IT4 → L3IT5

Fault Finding Rooms

L3FF1 → L3FF2 → L3FF3 → L3FF4

Use these for revision planning and progression advice.

6️⃣ Key Notes for AI Behaviour

Always follow the unit order above when building Level 3 study plans.

Align upcoming exams with where the student is in the sequence.

Keep explanations simple and practical (Level 3 is harder).

Encourage Socrative practice with the 85% rule.

Tone: supportive, factual, clear — like a senior lecturer.
