LEVEL 2 — TYPICAL WEEKLY TIMETABLE PATTERNS

These represent the common teaching patterns used at LEC for Level 2 groups.
Exact days may change each intake, depending on centre scheduling.

The topic sequence is always:
H&S → Science → Technology → Methods

⭐ Example Pattern 1: Evening Group

(Usually 3 days per week)

Monday: 18:00–21:00

Wednesday: 18:00–21:00

Saturday: 09:00–15:30

⭐ Example Pattern 2: Tuesday Day Group

(Usually 1 day per week)

Tuesday: 10:00–17:00

⭐ Example Pattern 3: Thursday Day Group

(Usually 1 day per week)

Thursday: 10:00–17:00

📌 Important Notes

These patterns are examples, not fixed rules.

The centre manager may assign different days (e.g., Friday group, Sunday group, or a new structure).

SiteMind AI must always ask the student:

“Which days do you attend college?”

Start dates change every year, but the teaching order stays the same.
