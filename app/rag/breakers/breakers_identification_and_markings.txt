TITLE: Circuit Breakers – Identification, Ratings, and Markings (UK)

PURPOSE:
This document enables SiteMind AI to identify circuit breakers from photos or markings
and explain their ratings clearly for UK electrical students and electricians.

Aligned with:
- BS 7671
- IEC 60898, 61008, 61009, 60947
- EAL Level 2 & Level 3 Electrical Installations

---

SECTION 1: BREAKER TYPES

MCB – Miniature Circuit Breaker  
Protects against overload and short circuit only.

RCD – Residual Current Device  
Protects against earth leakage only.

RCBO – Combined MCB + RCD  
Provides overcurrent and earth leakage protection.

MCCB – Moulded Case Circuit Breaker  
Used in commercial and industrial installations.

AFDD – Arc Fault Detection Device  
Detects dangerous arc faults.

SECTION 2: READING MARKINGS

Example marking: C40

Interpretation:
- Letter = Tripping curve
- Number = Rated current (amps)

C40 means:
- Type C
- 40 A rated current

---

SECTION 3: TRIPPING CURVES

Type B:
- Trips at 3–5 × In
- Used for lighting and domestic socket circuits

Type C:
- Trips at 5–10 × In
- Used for circuits with moderate inrush current (motors, fluorescent lighting)

Type D:
- Trips at 10–20 × In
- Used for high inrush current (industrial use)

---

SECTION 4: RATED CURRENT (In)

The maximum current the breaker can carry continuously.

Examples:
- B32 → 32 A
- C6 → 6 A
- C40 → 40 A

Design rule:
Ib ≤ In ≤ Iz

---

SECTION 5: BREAKING CAPACITY (kA)

Indicates the maximum fault current the breaker can safely interrupt.

Common values:
- 4.5 kA
- 6 kA
- 10 kA

UK guidance:
- 6 kA is standard for modern domestic installations
- 4.5 kA found in older boards

---

SECTION 6: OPERATING VOLTAGE

Common markings:
- 230V~
- 230/400V~

The ~ symbol indicates AC supply.

---

SECTION 7: ENERGY LIMITING CLASS

Class 1 / 2 / 3

Class 3 offers the highest level of energy limitation
and is common in modern domestic breakers.

---

SECTION 8: RCD / RCBO RESIDUAL CURRENT

Common values:
- 30 mA → personal protection
- 100 mA → fire protection
- 300 mA → fire protection (industrial)

Time delay:
- S-type = selective (delayed)

---

SECTION 9: STANDARDS

IEC 60898 → Domestic MCBs  
IEC 61008 → RCDs  
IEC 61009 → RCBOs  
IEC 60947 → Industrial MCCBs

---

SECTION 10: HOW SITE MIND AI SHOULD RESPOND

When shown a breaker:
1. Identify device type
2. Extract markings
3. Translate into plain English
4. Explain common use
5. Add an exam or site tip

If markings are unclear, ask for a clearer photo.

---

SECTION 11: COMMON STUDENT ERRORS

- Confusing B32 with 32 kA
- Thinking RCDs protect against overload
- Ignoring breaking capacity in exams

---

SECTION 12: EXAM TIP

In Level 2 exams, always identify:
- Breaker type
- Rated current
- Tripping curve
- Breaking capacity

These usually carry the marks.
