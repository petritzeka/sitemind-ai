Installation methods:
• T&E in walls or ceilings.
• Conduit (metal/plastic).
• Trunking, basket, tray.
• SWA cable: armour = CPC if compliant.

Termination methods:
• Strip, prepare, tighten to torque.
• Ferrules for stranded conductors.
• Glanding SWA (banjo, nuts, earth tail).

Reference methods:
• 100 = in a wall.
• 101 = surface mounted.
• 103 = clipped direct.
• Determines cable current rating.

Containment:
• Tray: for large bundles.
• Basket: lightweight cable support.
• Trunking: routes many circuits, requires fire-stopping.

Communication on site:
• Job sheets.
• RAMS.
• Drawings (schematics/layouts).

Testing procedures:
• Continuity, IR, polarity.
• Zs, Ze, PFC.
• RCD tests.

Documentation:
• EIC, EICR, Minor Works.
• Notes and variations.
