Fault types:
• Open circuit.
• Short circuit.
• Earth fault.
• High resistance connections.
• Mis-polarity.

Systematic approach:
1. Gather information (talk to client, check drawings).
2. Safe isolation.
3. Visual inspection.
4. Test using multimeter, continuity, IR, Zs.
5. Identify fault area.
6. Confirm diagnosis.
7. Repair or replace components.
8. Retest fully.
9. Record findings.

Common signs:
• MCB tripping → overcurrent or fault.
• RCD tripping → leakage or imbalance.
• No power → open circuit or loose termination.
