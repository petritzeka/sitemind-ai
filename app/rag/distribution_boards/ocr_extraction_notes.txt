OCR Extraction Notes

Common issues:
- "L" becomes "1"
- "O" becomes "0"
- "B32" becomes "832"
- "6A" becomes "GA"

Fixes:
- If "6A" detected as "GA", convert to "6A".
- If label ends in "32" with no letter, assume "B32".
- If RCBO detected as "RCD", check context.
- If description contains floor names ("up", "down"), convert to standard form.

Important:
Use common electrician logic to repair incomplete labels.
