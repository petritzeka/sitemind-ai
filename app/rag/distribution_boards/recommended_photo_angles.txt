Recommended Photo Angles for OCR:

- Full board exactly from the front.
- Labels must be clearly visible.
- Avoid shadows over circuit labels.
- If board is tall, take two photos:
  - Top half (RCDs, main switch)
  - Bottom half (MCBs/RCBOs)

Ask users to:
- Move cables gently if blocking labels.
- Turn flash on.
- Take photo at eye level.
