Three-Phase Distribution Boards (Commercial/Industrial)

Characteristics:
- L1/L2/L3 arrangement
- Terminal layouts vary heavily by manufacturer
- Circuits often labelled as:
  - L1 lights
  - L2 sockets
  - L3 AC units
  - Three-phase motors
  - Submains

OCR Notes:
- Phase numbers often detected incorrectly (L1 becomes “11”, L3 becomes “13”).
- Motor circuits often appear as “MTR”, “PMP”, “FAN”, “AC”.

Important:
For domestic-focused users, identify and respond that three-phase boards may require a different test sheet.
