Common mistakes when checking Zs:

- Using the wrong table (Type C instead of Type B)
- Forgetting that RCDs do not affect Zs values
- Not identifying device type properly
- Comparing Zs to Zc (wrong value)
- Using 80% rule (obsolete)
- Measuring Zs on a dead circuit (should be L+E loop)
- Using neutral instead of earth in loop test
