Steps to compare measured Zs to maximum Zs:

1. Find the device type:
   - B, C, D
   - MCB or RCBO

2. Find the rating:
   - 6A, 32A, etc.

3. Look up the maximum Zs in the tables.

4. Compare:
   If Measured Zs ≤ Maximum Zs → PASS  
   If Measured Zs > Maximum Zs → FAIL

5. If fail:
   - Check R1+R2 values
   - Check connections
   - Check bonding
   - Verify device type is correct
