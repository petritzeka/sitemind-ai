RCBO Boards (Fully loaded with RCBOs)

Characteristics:
- Each circuit has its own RCBO.
- Usually full protection and easier to understand.

- Circuit numbers often run top to bottom.

Typical circuits:
1. Lights (upstairs)
2. Lights (downstairs)
3. Sockets (upstairs)
4. Sockets (downstairs)
5. Cooker
6. Shower
7. Boiler

OCR Note:
RCBO boards are the easiest to parse because each device is clearly labelled individually.
