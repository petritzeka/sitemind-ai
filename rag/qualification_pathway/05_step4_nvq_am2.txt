Step 4 — NVQ Level 3 + AM2 (5–12 months)

NVQ:
• Mainly a portfolio of evidence collected on site.
• Includes photos, documents, job evidence, and practical tasks you complete at work.

AM2:
• A two-day practical exam (plus one short online exam).
• Tests installation, inspection & testing, fault finding, and understanding of BS 7671.

You cannot receive the NVQ certificate unless you:
• complete the full NVQ portfolio and
• pass the AM2 exam.

Typical timeframe: 5–12 months depending on work exposure.
This is clearly shown in the LEC Steps document.
