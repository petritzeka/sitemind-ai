TITLE: Installing Socket Outlets (Ring Final or Radial)

OVERVIEW:
Sockets are commonly installed on ring or radial circuits. This guide covers cable routing, termination and final checks.

TOOLS / PPE:
- Screwdrivers
- Cutters
- Level
- Tester
- PPE

MATERIALS:
- 2.5 mm² T&E cable
- Socket outlets
- Back boxes
- Fixings

SAFETY CHECKS:
- Prove dead before working.
- Keep cable runs in safe zones.

METHOD:
1. Mark socket height and install back box level.
2. Run cable vertically/horizontally in safe zones.
3. Strip conductors and terminate:
   - L (brown)
   - N (blue)
   - CPC (sleeved)
4. For ring final:
   - Two sets of L/N/E enter each socket.
   - Maintain continuity of ring.
5. Test R1+R2, polarity and insulation resistance.

GOOD PRACTICE:
- Tight but not overtightened terminals.
- CPC sleeved correctly.
- All connections secure.
