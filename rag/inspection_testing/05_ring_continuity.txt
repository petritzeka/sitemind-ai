Ring Final Circuit Continuity

You must test:
• r1 (line)
• rn (neutral)
• r2 (CPC)

Steps:

Measure r1, rn, r2 end-to-end.

Cross-connect r1–rn and test at each socket → readings should be consistent.

Cross-connect r1–r2 → this gives (R1+R2) at each socket.

Check for balanced readings; big variations suggest loose terminals.

A ring must be continuous; if readings are wrong, it may be broken or not a ring.
