Common Faults Found During Inspection & Testing

• Broken CPC
• Reversed polarity
• Ring final not completing the loop
• Low insulation values
• High Zs due to loose terminations
• Mixed conductors (e.g., borrowed neutrals)
• Incorrect protective device ratings
• No bonding or undersized bonding

Students should recognise these during practical assessments.
