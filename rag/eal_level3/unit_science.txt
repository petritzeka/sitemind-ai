AC theory:
• RMS values.
• Peak vs RMS.
• Frequency: 50 Hz.
• Impedance (Z) = √(R² + X²)
• Reactance: XL = 2πfL, XC = 1/(2πfC)

Power factor:
• PF = cos φ
• True power P = V × I × PF

Three-phase systems:
• Line voltage = 400 V.
• Phase voltage = 230 V.
• Balanced loads reduce neutral current.

Transformers:
• Vs/Vp = Ns/Np.
• Used in distribution and electronics.

Motors:
• AC induction motors.
• Starting currents higher than running.
• Star/delta starting.

Electronics:
• Diodes, rectifiers, capacitors, inductors.
• Smoothing and filtering.
