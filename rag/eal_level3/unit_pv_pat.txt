Solar PV (basic):
• Converts sunlight to DC power.
• Inverter converts DC to AC.
• DC isolators required.
• AC isolator near the consumer unit.
• Earthing arrangements vary (TT/TN).
• Overcurrent protection needed for AC side.

PV safety:
• DC cannot be switched off by main switch.
• Use correct DC-rated isolators.

PAT testing:
• Visual inspection.
• Earth continuity test.
• Insulation resistance test.
• Substitute leakage test (if needed).
• Equipment must be labelled after test.

Common faults:
• Damaged flexes.
• Incorrect fuse rating.
• Exposed conductive parts.
