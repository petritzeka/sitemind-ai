IP (Ingress Protection) ratings classify how well an electrical enclosure protects against solids (dust) and liquids (water).

Format:
IPXY
X = protection against solids
Y = protection against liquids

Example:
IP65 = Dust tight + Protected against water jets.

IP ratings help electricians choose suitable equipment for bathrooms, kitchens, outdoor areas, and industrial environments.
