The IP code has two main digits:

IPXY

X – First digit (0–6): Protection against solid objects.
Y – Second digit (0–9): Protection against water.

Optional letters:
- F = Oil resistant
- M = Tested with moving parts
- S = Tested with stationary parts

In domestic installations, the main concern is choosing the correct rating for bathrooms, outdoor areas, and kitchens.
