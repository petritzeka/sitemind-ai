Maximum Zs values in BS 7671 already include adjustment for normal operating temperature.

Important notes:
- You do NOT apply 80% rule anymore (it was for older tables).
- Zs values in tables are the final values you compare to.
- If Ze is high, you must check bonding and earthing system.

Temperature effects:
- High conductor temperature increases resistance.
- BS 7671 tables assume worst-case operating temperature.
