Maximum Zs values are taken from BS 7671 and depend on:
- Protective device type (MCB, RCBO, fuse)
- Device curve (B, C, D)
- Device rating (6A, 32A, etc.)
- Earthing system
- Voltage (230V)

Common domestic protective devices:
- BS EN 60898 (Type B, C, D MCBs)
- BS EN 61009 (RCBOs)
- BS 3036 rewireable fuses (old)

The values assume 0.4s disconnection time for final circuits up to 32A.
