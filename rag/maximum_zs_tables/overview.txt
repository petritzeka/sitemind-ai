This folder contains maximum Zs values used for checking final circuit disconnection times against BS 7671 requirements.

Zs = external earth fault loop impedance (Ze) + R1 + R2.

These tables are essential for:
- Testing and inspection
- Test sheets
- Assessing pass/fail on circuits
- Tutor Mode explanations
