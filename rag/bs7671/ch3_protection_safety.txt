BS 7671 Chapter 3 – Protection for Safety

Protection against electric shock:
• Basic protection: insulation, enclosures, barriers.
• Fault protection: automatic disconnection of supply (ADS).
• ADS requires correct Zs and disconnection times.

Additional protection:
• 30 mA RCDs required in many circuits (domestic, socket outlets, bathrooms).

Protection against overcurrent:
• Overload and short-circuit protection via fuses, MCBs, RCBOs.

Protection against earth faults:
• Provided by correct earthing and bonding.

Disconnection times:
• Final circuits ≤32A: 0.4s.
• Distribution circuits: 5s.

Other protections:
• Protection against thermal effects.
• Protection against overvoltages.
